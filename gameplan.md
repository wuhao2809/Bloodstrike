### üöÄ **Phase 4: Multiplayer P2P System** (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal**: Implement peer-to-peer multiplayer with asymmetric Player vs Mob King gameplay

**Current Status**: Phase 4a (Menu System) ‚úÖ COMPLETED, Phase 4b-partial ‚úÖ COMPLETED, **NEW Phase 4b-alternate: Dual Player Local Mode** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Game Design:

**Three Game Modes:**

1. **Single Player**: Current 4-level system (keep existing) - Mobs can shoot at Level 4
2. **Dual Player (Local)**: **Player vs Human Mob King** - **UPDATED IMPLEMENTATION** ‚úÖ 
3. **Multiplayer (Online)**: 2-minute survival challenge - Future implementation

**‚úÖ UPDATED: Dual Player Local Mode** 

**Human vs Human Local Controls:**
- **Player 1 (Survivor)**: WASD/Arrow keys movement, Mouse aim & click to shoot
- **Player 2 (Mob King)**: IJKL movement, P key to shoot in facing direction

**Combat System Update:**
- **Regular Mobs**: Cannot shoot in dual player mode (simplified for balance)
- **Mob King (Human-Controlled)**: Full combat abilities with directional shooting
- **Single Player Level 4**: Regular mobs still get weapons (existing behavior preserved)
- **Dual Player Mode**: Only human Mob King can shoot, regular mobs are basic

**Dual Player Rules:**
- **Player 1**: Survives against waves + Human Mob King (mouse aim & click)
- **Player 2**: Controls Mob King with IJKL movement + P to shoot in facing direction
- **Regular Mob Spawn**: Reduced frequency (2x interval) to balance with human Mob King
- **Mob King Stats**: 150 health, high damage (30), medium fire rate (1.5), long range (600)
- **Victory**: Player 1 wins by completing levels, Player 2 wins by eliminating Player 1

**Technical Implementation:**
```cpp
// ‚úÖ COMPLETED COMPONENTS
enum class GameMode {
    SINGLE_PLAYER,      // ‚úÖ Existing behavior
    DUAL_PLAYER_LOCAL,  // ‚úÖ UPDATED: Human vs Human local
    MULTIPLAYER_ONLINE  // üöß Future: Human vs Human online
};

// ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Input System Updates
// - Player 1: WASD/Arrow keys + mouse shooting
// - Player 2 (Mob King): IJKL movement + P directional shooting

// ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Weapon System Updates  
void handleMobKingShooting(ECS &ecs, float deltaTime);      // Human Mob King shooting
void handleRegularMobShooting(ECS &ecs, float deltaTime);   // AI mob shooting

// ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Smart shooting mechanics
// - Mob King: Shoots in movement direction (IJKL-based)
// - Regular mobs: Auto-aim at player (single player Level 4 only)
// - Dual player: Only human Mob King can shoot
```

#### Game Design:

**Two Game Modes:**

1. **Single Player**: Current 4-level system (keep existing)
2. **Multiplayer**: 2-minute survival challenge

**Multiplayer Rules:**

- **Player**: Survive 2 minutes to win (same controls as single-player)
- **Mob King**: Kill player to win (JKIL movement, ] for acceleration boost)
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Linear increase in mob spawn rate and speed over 2 minutes
- **Mob King Respawn**: 8-second timer when killed by player
- **Victory Conditions**: Player wins if survives 2min, Mob King wins if kills player

#### Technical Requirements:

**Networking Layer:**

- SDL_net TCP Host-Client architecture (Host has authority)
- Game state synchronization at 60 FPS
- Input prediction and lag compensation
- Connection handling (join, leave, disconnect)

**Collision Authority Design:**

- **Host Authority**: Mob spawning, mob-player collisions, victory conditions
- **Client Authority**: Own projectile collisions (immediate feedback)
- **Synchronization**: Collision results synced between clients

**Why This Hybrid Approach:**

- **Responsive Shooting**: Players get immediate feedback when hitting mobs
- **Fair Gameplay**: Host decides critical collisions (player death, victory)
- **Reduced Lag**: No waiting for host confirmation on every shot
- **Anti-Cheat**: Host validates all game-ending events

**New Systems Needed:**

```cpp
class NetworkSystem : public System {
    // Handle P2P connections, message sending/receiving
    // Synchronize game state between players
};

class MultiplayerGameManager : public GameManager {
    // Override single-player logic for multiplayer rules
    // Handle role assignment (Player vs Mob King)
    // Manage 2-minute timer and dynamic difficulty
};

class MobKingSystem : public System {
    // Handle human-controlled mob king movement
    // Manage acceleration boost (P key)
    // Handle respawn timer (8 seconds)
};
```

**New Components:**

```cpp
struct NetworkPlayer {
    uint32_t playerID;
    PlayerRole role; // PLAYER or MOB_KING
    bool isLocal;
};

struct MobKing {
    float accelerationBoost = 2.0f;
    float boostDuration = 1.0f;
    float boostCooldown = 3.0f;
    bool isAccelerating = false;
    float respawnTimer = 0.0f;
    bool isDead = false;
};

struct MultiplayerGameState {
    float survivalTimer = 120.0f; // 2 minutes
    float difficultyMultiplier = 1.0f;
    uint32_t playerID;
    uint32_t mobKingID;
};
```

                 ‚Üì
            Game Start ‚Üí Player vs Mob King
```

**Multiplayer Game Loop:**

```cpp
class MultiplayerGameManager : public GameManager {
private:
    float survivalTimer = 120.0f;  // 2 minutes
    PlayerRole localPlayerRole;
    float difficultyProgression;

public:
    void updateMultiplayerLogic(float deltaTime) {
        // Update 2-minute survival timer
        survivalTimer -= deltaTime;

        // Calculate dynamic difficulty (linear increase over 2 minutes)
        difficultyProgression = 1.0f + (120.0f - survivalTimer) / 120.0f;

        // Increase mob spawn rate over time
        mobSpawnInterval = 0.5f / difficultyProgression;

        // Increase mob speed over time
        mobSpeedMultiplier = 1.0f * difficultyProgression;

        // Check victory conditions
        if (survivalTimer <= 0.0f && localPlayerRole == PLAYER) {
            // Player wins by surviving 2 minutes
            gameOver(PLAYER_VICTORY);
        }
    }
};
```

**Network Message Structure:**

```cpp
struct NetworkMessage {
    MessageType type;
    uint32_t playerID;
    uint32_t timestamp;
    union {
        PlayerInputData playerInput;
        MobKingInputData mobKingInput;
        GameStateData gameState;
        ProjectileData projectile;
        DiceRollData diceRoll;

    } data;
};

struct DiceRollData {
    uint8_t playerDiceValue;
    uint8_t opponentDiceValue;
    uint32_t winnerPlayerID;
};

struct RoleSelectionData {
    PlayerRole selectedRole; // PLAYER or MOB_KING
    bool isConfirmed;
};
```

**Dice Roll & Role Selection Flow:**

```cpp
class LobbySystem : public System {
private:
    enum LobbyState {
        WAITING_FOR_CONNECTION,
        DICE_ROLL_PHASE,
        ROLE_SELECTION_PHASE,
        READY_TO_START
    };

public:
    void initiateDiceRoll() {
        // Both players roll dice (1-6)
        // Higher roll gets first pick of role
        // Display animated dice rolling for 2-3 seconds
        // Winner sees "You won! Choose your role first"
        // Loser sees "Opponent won, waiting for their choice..."
    }

    void handleRoleSelection(uint32_t winnerPlayerID) {
        // Winner picks Player or Mob King
        // Loser automatically gets remaining role
        // Display final role assignments
        // 3-second countdown before game starts
    }
};
```

**Lobby UI Flow:**

1. **Connection Phase:**

   ```
   Host: "Waiting for player to join..."
   Join: "Connecting to [IP]..."
   ```

2. **Dice Roll Phase:**

   ```
   "Both players connected!"
   "Rolling dice to decide role priority..."
   [Animated dice: üé≤ üé≤]
   "You rolled: 4, Opponent rolled: 6"
   "Opponent wins! They choose first."
   ```

3. **Role Selection Phase:**

   ```
   Winner: "Choose your role:"
           [Player Button] [Mob King Button]

   Loser:  "Waiting for opponent to choose..."
           "Opponent chose: Player"
           "You are: Mob King"
   ```

4. **Game Start:**
   ```
   "Final Roles: You=Mob King, Opponent=Player"
   "Game starting in 3... 2... 1..."
   ```

**Dice Roll Implementation:**

```cpp
class DiceRollSystem {
private:
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 gen;

public:
    DiceRollSystem() : gen(rd()) {}

    uint8_t rollDice() {
        std::uniform_int_distribution<> dis(1, 6);
        return dis(gen);
    }

    void synchronizeDiceRoll(NetworkSystem* network) {
        // Both players roll simultaneously
        // Send results to each other
        // Determine winner (higher roll wins, re-roll on tie)
        // Winner gets first choice of role
    }
};
```

## üéØ Development Questions & Decisions

**‚úÖ Technical Decisions Made:**

1. **Control Scheme**: ‚úÖ JKIL for Mob King (future local multiplayer), ] for acceleration

2. **Network Architecture**: ‚úÖ Host-Client model for simpler authority management

3. **Collision Authority**: ‚úÖ Hybrid approach:

   - Host: Mob spawning, mob-player collisions, victory conditions
   - Client: Own projectile collisions (immediate feedback)
   - Sync: Results communicated between clients

4. **State Synchronization**: ‚úÖ 60 FPS for smooth gameplay

5. **Dynamic Difficulty**: ‚úÖ Linear increase over 2 minutes

6. **Mob King Abilities**: ‚úÖ Start with acceleration only (] key)
   - Future possibilities: Dash attack, temporary invincibility, spawn extra mobs

**Next Steps:**

1. **Immediate**: Start with menu system enhancement
2. **SDL_net Integration**: Add dependency to CMakeLists.txt
3. **Architecture**: Create base networking classes
4. **Testing Strategy**: How to test P2P locally?

Would you like to start with any specific part, or shall we begin with the menu system enhancement? üöÄ
